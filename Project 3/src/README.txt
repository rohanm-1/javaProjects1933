- Working With Partner
    Contributions:
        Aidan mainly worked on the LinkedList class, while Rohan mainly worked on the ArrayList class.
        However, we both collaboratively worked on the classes/methods whenever one of us struggled
        or to understand the logic of every method created.

- How to compile and run my program
    In order to run the program all the associated classes must first be compiled.
    Simply type in "javac" followed by class name and ".java" into the terminal for each class.
    This will compile all the files and allow them to be read by the computer.
    Once compiled, feel free to run test methods on the programs.
- Any assumptions
    We used a helper method for the LinkedList class to check for sorting to pass the isSortedTest. However, because the
    traversal for ArrayList is significantly shorter, we didn't add a helper method for that class.
- Additional features
    No additional features beside helper method
- No known bugs or defects as of testing on both personal and school computers on 4/5/2024

- Outside sources consulted:
    -used help from this youtube tutorial as its a leetcode question ive done before for reverse linked list

I certify that the information contained in this README file
is complete and accurate. I have both read and followed the course
policies in the 'Academic Integrity - Course Policy' section of the course syllabus.
