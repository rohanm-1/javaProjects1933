- How to compile and run my program
    3 shape objects are made in this program: Triangle, Circle, and Rectangle. We use these
    shapes to create fractals (via recursion and Canvas.java) using FractalDrawer.java

    Actual compilation of this program occurs in the FractalDrawer.java class, where a user can
    choose the shape of their fractal (circle, rectangle, or triangle) and the program utilizes
    recursion of a depth of 7 levels to create a fractal of the user's choice.
- Any assumptions
    All instructions were followed exactly as described by the project, so no major assumptions are
    needed. However, I would like to note some clarifications:
        - Variable names were descriptive and kept consistent within the class itself; however, there
        may be some differences between the objects created (ex: xpos may be a variable in one class but
        in another class it is written as x_pos)
        - There is likely a more efficient way to cycle through colors for each recursive call to draw
        the shapes. However, this was a method I thought of myself (even after getting stuck for a while)
        with no outside sources, so I decided to keep this implementation
- Additional features
    An additional feature could be a personal Color[] array I used to cycle through red, green, and blue.
    Other than this, most features were created according to the project instructions
- No known bugs or defects as of testing on both personal and school computers on 2/16/2024
- Outside sources consulted:
    I mainly consulted GeeksForGeeks to understand Java syntax and how to properly implement something
    I would already be comfortable implementing in a language I am more used to. I also consulted Alex Lee,
    a content creator who makes concise Java Tutorials on commonly misunderstood concepts.
