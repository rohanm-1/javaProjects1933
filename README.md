This is my repository for all the Java projects for CSCI 1933 - Introduction to Data 
Structures and Algorithms at the University of Minnesota: Twin Cities. Here is a quick overview of each project:

**Project 1:**


This project utilized recursion to draw fractals in different shapes (circles, rectangles, triangles, etc.) with alternating
colors.

**Project 2:**


This project utilized a 2D array and experience with JUnit tests to create the popular board game chess.

**Project 3:**


This project involved creating our own ArrayList and LinkedList classes and functions and comparing their complexities.

**Project 4:**


This project involved using stacks, queues, and 2D arrays in order to create a fully functional version of the Minesweeper game.
